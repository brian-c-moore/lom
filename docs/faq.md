## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **What is LOM and why was it created?**

LOM is a governance-agnostic methodology for structuring and managing operational workflows. It was created to provide a structured but adaptable approach to workflow management, ensuring efficiency, visibility, and automation without being prescriptive.

---

### **Is LOM a DevOps or Lean IT solution?**

No. While LOM is influenced by DevOps and Lean IT principles, it is not a DevOps framework. LOM does not attempt to maintain strict adherence to any specific methodology. Instead, it borrows useful concepts and applies them practically to operational workflows.

---

### What is LifecycleOps, and how does it relate to LOM?
LifecycleOps is a term used to describe the structured alignment of operational workflows with governance frameworks. It represents the mindset and methodology behind the Lifecycle Operations Model (LOM). LifecycleOps refers more broadly to the practice of ensuring work progresses efficiently through governance-aligned lifecycle stages. 

---

### What gap does LOM address with other frameworks?
Many frameworks, such as ITIL, DevOps, and SecOps, define lifecycle models but do not prescribe how work should progress operationally. This creates a gap between governance and execution. LOM fills this gap by:
- Providing a structured way to map work items to governance-aligned lifecycles.
- Enabling workflow tracking that aligns with operational needs while preserving compliance.
- Ensuring feedback loops exist through detailed workflow statuses, rather than generic statuses like 'In Progress' or 'Pending.'
- Bridging ITSM and ITOM—where ITSM tracks service requests and governance, ITOM ensures monitoring and execution, but neither fully ensures efficient human-driven workflow progression.

LOM’s approach allows teams to take existing lifecycle governance models and map workflows to them, rather than imposing an entirely new structure. This makes LOM universally adaptable across different industries and governance frameworks.

---

### Why LOM?
Many existing frameworks either lack operational structure or are too rigid to adapt to different workflows. LOM bridges this gap by offering:
- A structured but flexible model that aligns with governance frameworks without enforcing strict rules.
- Better visibility through workflow statuses to track progress and identify inefficiencies.
- Support for both structured and loosely defined workflows, ensuring applicability across various teams.
- A foundation for automation making it easier for organizations to introduce efficiency improvements.
- A standardized approach that improves consistency while allowing teams to customize as needed.

LOM is designed to bring order to complex workflows without sacrificing adaptability.

---

### **When should I use LOM?**

LOM is valuable when:

- Workflows involve multiple lifecycle stages that need tracking.
- Workflows have unpredictable, looping, or irregular patterns.
- Standardization and repeatability are needed.
- Workflow tracking can benefit from automation.
- Organizations need operational metrics (e.g., bottleneck analysis).

---

### **When is LOM unnecessary?**

LOM is less useful in:

- **Highly prescriptive workflows** where every step is already defined (e.g., ITIL Change Management).
- **Linear, one-directional processes** with no iterative loops.
- **Compliance-driven reviews** that require strict adherence to predefined controls.
- **Basic, low-complexity tasks** that can be managed with simple automation.

---

### **What if we already have a process that works well?**  

If your process is reliable, efficient, and meets your organization’s needs, please continue using it. LOM is designed for teams looking to improve or formalize their workflows. If you’ve got everything running smoothly, there’s no need for a major overhaul.

---

### **How does LOM differ from ITIL, NIST, or MITRE ATT&CK?**

- **ITIL**: ITIL provides prescriptive workflows, while LOM is flexible and adaptable.
- **NIST**: NIST offers security frameworks; LOM applies them operationally.
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: MITRE ATT&CK maps threats, but does not define workflows—LOM provides structure.

---

### **Can LOM be applied to non-security workflows?**

Yes! While many examples focus on security operations, LOM can be used in **any structured or loosely defined workflow**, including IT operations, software development, and compliance tracking.
