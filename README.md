# Lifecycle Operations Model (LOM)

## Introduction

The **Lifecycle Operations Model (LOM)** is a structured approach for aligning operational workflows with governance frameworks while ensuring efficiency, continuous improvement, and adaptability. LOM is rooted in principles from Lean IT, DevOps, and workflow optimization, designed to provide a flexible, governance-agnostic methodology for structuring work processes across IT, Security, and Operations. By applying LOM, organizations can streamline operational processes, ensure compliance, and integrate automation effectively.

> *LOM is highly effective in workflows requiring structure, automation, or tracking. However, not every process benefits equally. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for details on when LOM is most effective.*

## Origins and Philosophy

LOM was created out of a need to effectively manage high volumes of operational support work while maintaining efficiency and consistency. It was inspired by DevOps and Lean IT methodologies, which emphasize streamlining workflows and improving visibility through structured processes. The goal was to apply these principles to operational work, ensuring tasks move efficiently through well-defined stages. In LOM, workflows are derived directly from governing frameworks, ensuring alignment with compliance, security, and business objectives.

### Key Inspirations Behind LOM

- **The Three Ways (Flow, Feedback, Continuous Learning)** – LOM aligns with DevOps principles of improving flow, reinforcing feedback loops, and encouraging continuous experimentation.
- **Lean IT** – Focuses on eliminating inefficiencies and optimizing how work progresses through structured pipelines.
- **Lifecycle Thinking** – Everything has a lifecycle, making it a universal concept that can be easily adapted to various workflows while aligning naturally with DevOps principles.
- **Governance-Driven Structure** – Applying a top-down approach ensures alignment with organizational goals, risk management, and compliance requirements.

> **“Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”** – *Stephen R. Covey*

By focusing on lifecycle alignment (doing the right things) and DevOps methodologies (doing them right), LOM ensures that organizations operate efficiently while maintaining strategic alignment with governance frameworks.

## The Three Ways and How They Influence LOM

LOM aligns with The Three Ways, a set of foundational DevOps principles described in *The Phoenix Project* that emphasize efficiency, feedback, and continuous improvement in IT operations:

1. **The First Way: Flow** – LOM improves workflow efficiency by ensuring that operational tasks move seamlessly through lifecycle stages. By structuring work through governance-aligned lifecycles and automating repetitive tasks, organizations can reduce bottlenecks and improve service delivery.
2. **The Second Way: Feedback** – LOM emphasizes workflow statuses as a primary feedback mechanism, enabling real-time visibility into how work progresses through a lifecycle. By tracking status changes and cycle times, organizations can detect inefficiencies, adjust workflows, and improve operational throughput.
3. **The Third Way: Continuous Learning & Experimentation** – LOM encourages a culture of iterative improvement, where teams track operational performance, analyze failures, and evolve workflows to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

By incorporating these principles, LOM builds on the core tenets of DevOps, Lean IT, and ITSM to create a scalable, governance-agnostic model that ensures operational excellence.

## Core Principles

1. **Lifecycle-Driven Operations** – Workflows are structured around clear lifecycle stages that reflect governance requirements or operational needs. This provides clarity in execution and ensures work items progress through well-defined phases, reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
2. **Visibility & Measurability** – A workflow should provide trackable workflow statuses in tools such as Jira, ServiceNow, or SOAR platforms. Metrics and reporting mechanisms should be embedded to ensure continuous improvement and accountability.
3. **Continuous Monitoring & Feedback** – Workflow statuses serve as the primary feedback mechanism, providing insight into how work progresses through the lifecycle. This visibility enables teams to identify bottlenecks, improve response times, and adjust processes as needed.
4. **Scalability & Adaptability** – LOM is applicable across multiple disciplines, including IT, security, cloud operations, and compliance management. It integrates seamlessly with evolving technologies and governance models, ensuring that organizations can apply it in diverse operational environments.
5. **Automation & Efficiency** – Where appropriate, repetitive and manual processes should be automated using technologies like Ansible, AWS Lambda, and SOAR tools to minimize human error and accelerate response times.
